# JS Calculator
The assignment tonight is just to redo the calculator assignment, but don't use
`eval`. I encourage you to start from scratch, but the example code from class
is available on the class organization page. The goal is to learn JavaScript
better, so don't get hung up on the styling.

## Tasks
- [ ] Read [this JavaScript
  intro](http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/javascript-basics), executing the
  example code in the browser console to make sure you understand how it works.
- [ ] Get as far as you can making a calculator using only `if`, `switch`, and
  functions (i.e. don't use `eval`)
