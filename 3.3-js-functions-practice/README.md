# js-functions-practice

## Description

This assignment serves to reinforce JS syntax, functions, and some mathematical operators and sequences.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should:

* Understand general JS syntax
* Grasp why functions are important
* Understand arrays and loops
* Be able to breakdown a simple process of mathematical steps into a series of statements in JS

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* `console.assert`

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `main.js`

### Requirements

* No JSHint warnings or errors
* All functions should be complete and produce the expected output

## Normal Mode

#### Getting Started
  * [ ] Create a new issue with tasks
  * [ ] Create a new repository
  * [ ] Create a new branch based on `master` named `<initials>-develop`
  * [ ] Create and commit `index.html`
  * [ ] Push and open a Pull Request to `master`
  * [ ] HTML Boilerplate

#### Functions Practice
  * [ ] Create and commit a new file in called `main.js`
  * [ ] Copy the contents of `exercises-1.js` to `main.js`
  * [ ] Link `index.html` to `main.js`
  * [ ] Use `console.assert` to write assertions about the expected behavior for
        all of the functions
  * [ ] Make the assertions pass by filling in parameters and code.
  * [ ] Done!
